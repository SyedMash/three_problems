In Python, the is operator checks for identity, determining if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory, while the in operator checks for membership, determining if a value exists within a container like a list, tuple, string, or dictionary. For example, x is y would return True if both x and y refer to the same object, even if their contents differ, whereas 'apple' in fruits would return True if 'apple' exists as an element in the fruits list. Essentially, is tests object sameness, while in tests inclusion in a collection.
